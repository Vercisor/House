House Simulation by Davide Gamba

To Start the simulation, type:

java House "NameOfYourFile".txt 7 3

where the two numbers, 7 and 3 represent the number of days and the number of hours.
These parameters can be changed by the user as he pleases. 

The program also works with 0 days as parameter but also with 0 as the hour parameter if days is at least 1
so it is possible to run:

java House "NameOfYourFile".txt 0 3

to run the simulation for 3 hours only

or 

java House "NameOfYourFile".txt 2 0

to run the simulation for 2 days
